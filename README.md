csharp-classdiagram-generator
=============================

This is a simple class diagram generator for C# 4.0 language. It is a command line tool and requires Python3 to run.

# Running cscdgenerator

If you don't have antlr3 runtime installed (which is most propable):
```bash
$ cd <repository_directory>
$ source virtualenv/bin/activate
$ ./build/cscdgenerator.py
```

Alternatively, if you have all the development libraries, just run `cscdgenerator.py`
